# Acceptance record: A1 MCP

The MCP half of milestone A1: the server reads TLCMap's API v2 and offers four tools. Accepted in
three parts, following
[spec §12](../specs/A1-MCP.md#12-acceptance).
Each part runs against its own TLCMap, with its own dataset, so each names its own layers.

| Part | Server | Upstream | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local | `http://localhost:3100` | `http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local` | **Accepted 2026-11-06** |
| Staging | `https://test-mcp.tlcmap.org` | `https://test-ghap.tlcmap.org` | Pending: v2 is not yet on test-ghap |
| Production | none in A1 (`mcp.tlcmap.org` is Phase C) | `https://tlcmap.org` | Pending: v2 is not yet released |

## Local

Checked on **2026-11-06**.

**Result: all eight checks pass.**

### Roles

| Role | Local |
| --- | --- |
| `warning` `"None"`, no licence | 206 |
| a restrictive licence | 258 |
| an HTML warning | 472 |
| a private layer | 33 |
| a layer that needs many pages | 461 (17,917 records) |
| a missing layer | 99999999 |
| the region | the Hunter Valley box `150.8,-33.1,151.4,-32.6` |

### Method

Claude Code made every tool call of checks 2 to 7 in one headless session, with only the server's
tools and the MCP resource tools allowed. Its `stream-json` output records each tool result
verbatim, as the agent received it. A script then compared those results in code with `curl` of
the request named in each result's `provenance.request`: totals, ids, `sha256` of the bytes, and
v2's objects by serialised equality, key order included. No number below was transcribed by a
model. An SDK client read the resources byte for byte and called the error cases a second time, to
show the error result's `structuredContent`, which Claude Code does not display (see the note under
check 7).

### 1. CI is green, and `npm run test:compat` passes against local v2 — PASS

- CI on [pull request #2](https://github.com/Systemik-Solutions/tlcmap-mcp/pull/2): run
  42172378434 (`pull_request`) and run 42172348615 (`push`), both on `8ff76d5` (this record's first
  commit, whose code is `21b525d`'s), both `success`.
- Workstation, on `21b525d`: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` and `npm test` pass (17 files,
  225 tests).
- `TLCMAP_BASE_URL=http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local npm run test:compat`:

```text
✓ API v2 compatibility at http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local > serves layer 206 detail
✓ API v2 compatibility at http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local > serves layer 206 features
✓ API v2 compatibility at http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local > rejects an unknown layer with LAYER_NOT_FOUND
✓ API v2 compatibility at http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local > rejects per_page 0 with INVALID_PARAMETER
Tests  4 passed (4)
```

Run with no `TLCMAP_BASE_URL`, the check goes to `https://tlcmap.org` and fails all four, as
expected: production does not serve v2 yet.

### 2. Claude Code connects and lists exactly the four tools — PASS

```text
$ claude mcp add --transport http tlcmap-local http://localhost:3100/mcp
Added HTTP MCP server tlcmap-local with URL: http://localhost:3100/mcp to local config
$ claude mcp get tlcmap-local
  Scope: Local config (private to you in this project)
  Status: ✔ Connected
  Type: http
  URL: http://localhost:3100/mcp
```

Asked to list the server's tools:

```text
mcp__tlcmap-local__tlcmap_get_layer
mcp__tlcmap-local__tlcmap_get_layer_metadata
mcp__tlcmap-local__tlcmap_list_layers
mcp__tlcmap-local__tlcmap_search_places
COUNT=4
```

The registration was removed afterwards (`claude mcp remove tlcmap-local -s local`).

### 3. `tlcmap_list_layers` with the region's box matches `curl` — PASS

`{"bbox":[150.8,-33.1,151.4,-32.6]}` requested
`GET http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local/api/v2/layers?bbox=150.8,-33.1,151.4,-32.6`.

| | Tool | `curl` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `total` | 8 | 8 |
| layer ids | 84, 102, 140, 170, 206, 379, 461, 462 | 84, 102, 140, 170, 206, 379, 461, 462 |

The `layers` array is identical to v2's, key order included, and `provenance.sha256`
(`eca16310…bd98c`) is the SHA-256 of `curl`'s body.

### 4. `tlcmap_get_layer_metadata` returns the rights fields byte for byte — PASS

Each tool result's `layer` and `summary` are identical to `curl` of `GET /api/v2/layers/{id}`, key
order included:

| Layer | `warning` | `license` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 206 | `"None"` | `null` |
| 258 | `"This layer contains historical information about Aboriginal people th…"` (141 characters) | `"Do not use without permission."` |
| 472 | `"<p>Thus <strong>this</strong> is a <em>warning</em></p>"` (HTML, unchanged) | `null` |

### 5. Paging layers 206 and 461 — PASS

| Layer | Calls | Record ids | Distinct | `summary.total` | Final `next_cursor` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 206, `per_page=30` | 2 | 52 | 52 | 52 | `null` |
| 461, `per_page=5000` | 4 | 17,917 | 17,917 | 17,917 | `null` |

Claude Code followed each `next_cursor` itself. For each of the six pages, `provenance.sha256` is
the SHA-256 of `curl`'s body for the same request, and `provenance.record_uids` lists the page's
`properties.id`s in order. Layer 461's pages were 4,006,726, 3,996,296, 4,004,947 and 2,346,147
bytes.

### 6. `tlcmap_search_places` in the region — PASS

- `{"bbox":[…],"summary_only":true}` requested
  `GET /api/v2/places?bbox=150.8,-33.1,151.4,-32.6&summary_only=true`. Its `summary` is identical to
  `curl`'s (`total` 1,318, 8 `by_layer` entries). `page` and `resource_uri` are `null` and
  `record_uids` is `[]`.
- `{"bbox":[…],"per_page":20}` returned `resource_uri`
  `tlcmap://search/65a6d159a0e38a529ed98923fbdf79f7893b47315a35e2d111fe75048deba024`, with
  `provenance.sha256` equal to that hash and to the SHA-256 of `curl`'s 25,586-byte body.
- Claude Code read that resource; the SHA-256 of the text it received equals the tool's. An SDK
  `resources/read` returned `application/json` with the same SHA-256.

### 7. Errors carry v2's code, message and details — PASS

Each `structuredContent.error` (SDK client) against `curl` of the request it names:

```text
tlcmap_get_layer_metadata {"layer_id":33}
  tool  {"code":"LAYER_PRIVATE","message":"Layer 33 exists but is not public.",
         "details":{"layer_id":33,"request":"GET http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local/api/v2/layers/33","status":403}}
  curl  403 {"error":{"code":"LAYER_PRIVATE","message":"Layer 33 exists but is not public.","details":{"layer_id":33}}}

tlcmap_get_layer_metadata {"layer_id":99999999}
  tool  {"code":"LAYER_NOT_FOUND","message":"Layer 99999999 does not exist.",
         "details":{"layer_id":99999999,"request":"GET …/api/v2/layers/99999999","status":404}}
  curl  404 {"error":{"code":"LAYER_NOT_FOUND","message":"Layer 99999999 does not exist.","details":{"layer_id":99999999}}}

tlcmap_search_places {"extended_data":"Years > many"}
  tool  {"code":"FILTER_REJECTED","message":"The extended_data filter was rejected at position 8; expected a number.",
         "details":{"expression":"Years > many","position":8,"expected":"a number",
                    "request":"GET …/api/v2/places?extended_data=Years%20%3E%20many","status":400}}
  curl  400 {"error":{"code":"FILTER_REJECTED","message":"…","details":{"expression":"Years > many","position":8,"expected":"a number"}}}

tlcmap_get_layer {"layer_id":206,"per_page":6000}
  tool  {"code":"INVALID_PARAMETER","message":"The parameter 'per_page' must be between 1 and 5000.",
         "details":{"parameter":"per_page","rule":"range","accepts":"1–5000",
                    "request":"GET …/api/v2/layers/206/features?per_page=6000","status":400}}
  curl  400 {"error":{"code":"INVALID_PARAMETER","message":"…","details":{"parameter":"per_page","rule":"range","accepts":"1–5000"}}}
```

In each, the code and message are v2's and every one of v2's detail keys is present with v2's
value, plus `request` and `status`.

**Note: what Claude Code shows the agent.** For an error, Claude Code passes the agent only the
result's text block, `CODE: message`, for example
`INVALID_PARAMETER: The parameter 'per_page' must be between 1 and 5000.` The `details` in
`structuredContent` do not reach it. That is A0's wire shape (spec §9.1), unchanged. v2's messages
already name the parameter and the rule, so the agent still learns what to change, but `details`
such as `accepts` or `position` are seen only by clients that read `structuredContent`.

### Server log

Every call logged one `upstream` and one `tool` line; there were 20 of each across the session and
the SDK's second pass. Extract:

```text
{"level":"info","event":"upstream","url":"http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local/api/v2/layers?bbox=150.8,-33.1,151.4,-32.6","status":200,"bytes":4898,"queue_wait_ms":0,"duration_ms":689}
{"level":"info","event":"tool","tool":"tlcmap_list_layers","arguments":{"bbox":[150.8,-33.1,151.4,-32.6]},"outcome":"ok","cache":"miss","duration_ms":693}
{"level":"info","event":"upstream","url":"http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local/api/v2/layers/461/features?per_page=5000","status":200,"bytes":4006726,"queue_wait_ms":0,"duration_ms":2572}
{"level":"info","event":"tool","tool":"tlcmap_get_layer","arguments":{"layer_id":461,"per_page":5000},"outcome":"ok","cache":"miss","duration_ms":2625}
{"level":"warn","event":"upstream","url":"http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local/api/v2/layers/33","outcome":"LAYER_PRIVATE","duration_ms":414}
{"level":"warn","event":"tool","tool":"tlcmap_get_layer_metadata","arguments":{"layer_id":33},"outcome":"LAYER_PRIVATE","duration_ms":414}
{"level":"warn","event":"upstream","url":"http://tlcmap-ghap.laragon.local/api/v2/layers/206/features?per_page=6000","outcome":"INVALID_PARAMETER","duration_ms":381}
{"level":"warn","event":"tool","tool":"tlcmap_get_layer","arguments":{"layer_id":206,"per_page":6000},"outcome":"INVALID_PARAMETER","duration_ms":392}
```

`/healthz` afterwards showed `last_error` `null` and `last_success_at` at the time of the last `400`
(spec §9.3: a caller's `400`, `403` or `404` is v2 answering as designed):

```json
{"status":"ok","version":"0.2.0","cache":{"entries":12,"bytes":14443109},
 "upstream":{"requests_total":20,"in_flight":0,"queued":0,"last_success_at":"2026-11-06T06:03:58.050Z","last_error":null}}
```

### 8. After a restart, earlier resource URIs return `RESOURCE_EXPIRED` — PASS

The server process was stopped and started again; `/healthz` then showed `cache.entries` `0`. On
Windows the process was ended with `taskkill /F`, so no `shutdown` line was logged. An SDK
`resources/read` of each earlier handle:

```json
{"code":-32603,
 "message":"RESOURCE_EXPIRED: This resource is no longer held by the server. Call tlcmap_search_places again to obtain a fresh handle.",
 "data":{"code":"RESOURCE_EXPIRED","details":{"uri":"tlcmap://search/65a6d159a0e38a529ed98923fbdf79f7893b47315a35e2d111fe75048deba024","tool":"tlcmap_search_places"}}}
{"code":-32603,
 "message":"RESOURCE_EXPIRED: This resource is no longer held by the server. Call tlcmap_get_layer again to obtain a fresh handle.",
 "data":{"code":"RESOURCE_EXPIRED","details":{"uri":"tlcmap://layer/206/features/a10b2027aaf71ee28941749a9a43c63f331de62d0f47581007f0e1e35263b1f5","tool":"tlcmap_get_layer"}}}
```

A second Claude Code session read the search handle and received
`RESOURCE_EXPIRED: This resource is no longer held by the server. Call tlcmap_search_places again to obtain a fresh handle.`
The server logged
`{"level":"warn","event":"resource","uri":"tlcmap://search/65a6…a024","outcome":"RESOURCE_EXPIRED","duration_ms":1}`.

## Staging

**Pending.** Runs when v2 is deployed to test-ghap. Until then `test-mcp.tlcmap.org` serves 0.1.0
against production's v1, unchanged.

Prerequisites (spec §10), each to be recorded here:

- v2 deployed to `https://test-ghap.tlcmap.org`.
- `API_V2_RATE_LIMIT` there set for the MCP server's load. Layer 461's 17,917 records are four
  calls at `per_page=5000` on their own.
- `TrustProxies` configured for test-ghap's proxy, so that v2 does not see every client as one
  address and share one rate-limit key among them.
- One host serves both test-ghap and the MCP server, so the server's requests reach v2 from that
  host's own address and the limit applies to it.

Steps (spec §12.2):

1. Run `TLCMAP_BASE_URL=https://test-ghap.tlcmap.org npm run test:compat`.
2. Choose staging's layers for each role and record them in a roles table.
3. Set `TLCMAP_BASE_URL=https://test-ghap.tlcmap.org` in `/etc/tlcmap-mcp/env` and deploy 0.2.0 to
   `test-mcp.tlcmap.org` ([`deploy/DEPLOY.md`](https://github.com/Systemik-Solutions/tlcmap-mcp/blob/main/deploy/DEPLOY.md)).
4. Repeat checks 2 to 8 against `https://test-mcp.tlcmap.org/mcp` with staging's layers.
5. Check A0 §13's deploy and rollback for the new release.

## Production

**Pending.** Runs when v2 is released on `https://tlcmap.org`. A1 deploys no production MCP server;
`mcp.tlcmap.org` is Phase C.

Prerequisites (spec §10): v2 deployed to tlcmap.org, with `API_V2_RATE_LIMIT` and `TrustProxies`
set for it.

Steps (spec §12.3):

1. Run `npm run test:compat` (its default upstream is `https://tlcmap.org`) and record the result.
2. Confirm and record production's layers for each role: 206 (`warning` `"None"`, no licence), 1125
   (a restrictive licence), 2749 (an HTML warning), and a private layer still to be identified.
