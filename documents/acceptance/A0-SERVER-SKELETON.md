# Acceptance record: A0 server skeleton (staging)

Checked by hand on **2026-11-03** against `https://test-mcp.tlcmap.org`, following
[spec §13](../specs/A0-SERVER-SKELETON.md#13-acceptance).

**Result: all eight checks pass.**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Commit | `9eb16a344f2f93d083848bd716d03e1a6948bf12` |
| Tag | `v0.1.0` |
| Served version | `0.1.0` (`/healthz`) |
| Release directory | `/opt/tlcmap-mcp/releases/9eb16a344f2f` |
| Node | `v24.22.2` at `/usr/bin/node` (NodeSource), npm `11.19.1` |
| Host | Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS, Apache 2.4.52 (prefork), certbot 5.9.0 (snap) |
| Upstream | `https://tlcmap.org` (production) |
| Certificate | Let's Encrypt, ECDSA, expires 2027-02-01; renews with the host's certbot timer |

The host also serves `test-ghap.tlcmap.org` and `test-views.tlcmap.org`. `test-ghap` returned `200`
after each Apache reload, and both returned `200` once setup and the checks were finished.

## Checks

### 1. CI is green and `npm run test:prod` passes — PASS

- CI: run 41633891666 (`a0-server-skeleton`) and run 41634642068 (`v0.1.0`), both on `9eb16a3`,
  both `success`.
- Workstation pre-flight on `9eb16a3`: `npm ci && npm test` gives 13 files and 157 tests passing;
  `npm run test:prod` gives 3 tests passing against production.

### 2. Claude Code connects and lists exactly one tool — PASS

Claude Code 2.1.317, in a scratch directory (local scope, removed afterwards):

```text
$ claude mcp add --transport http tlcmap https://test-mcp.tlcmap.org/mcp
Added HTTP MCP server tlcmap with URL: https://test-mcp.tlcmap.org/mcp to local config
$ claude mcp get tlcmap
  Status: ✔ Connected
```

Asked in that session to list the server's tools and call one:

```text
mcp__tlcmap__tlcmap_get_layer
COUNT=1
record_count=52 cache=hit
```

An SDK client (`@modelcontextprotocol/client` 2.4.0) got the same single tool,
`tlcmap_get_layer`, under both protocol eras: `2026-07-28` (negotiation `auto`) and `2025-11-25`
(negotiation `legacy`).

### 3. Correct summaries with provenance; 2749's warning byte-for-byte; 206's `"None"` — PASS

Layer 206:

```json
{
  "record_count": 52, "undated_count": 52, "ungeolocated_count": 0, "date_range": null,
  "extent": [115.7544702, -42.88144955, 151.6112744, -31.95200028],
  "metadata.warning": "None", "metadata has license": false,
  "provenance": { "request": "GET https://tlcmap.org/layers/206/json", "cache": "miss",
    "sha256": "34aa22de5b7b32f184e26906bbf5cbde2dfb22399075f461387b07d33d787cb8",
    "bytes": 109369, "record_uids": "52 entries", "server": "tlcmap-mcp 0.1.0" }
}
```

Layer 2749:

```json
{
  "record_count": 1602, "undated_count": 0, "ungeolocated_count": 0,
  "extent": [141.43997, -37.063271, 153.616057, -28.16951],
  "date_range": { "start": { "udate": -56960273092000, "as_written": "165" },
                  "end":   { "udate": 28811509200000,  "as_written": "2099" } },
  "provenance": { "request": "GET https://tlcmap.org/layers/2749/json", "cache": "miss",
    "sha256": "c1ac2a6168046ed88393c7bc204e20e506409f01957a8dda290715958bd0f266",
    "bytes": 4457978, "record_uids": "1602 entries", "server": "tlcmap-mcp 0.1.0" }
}
```

The tool's `metadata.warning` for 2749 (273 characters of HTML, beginning `<p>Aboriginal and/or
Torres Strait Islander Peoples are advised…`) is identical to `metadata.warning` from
`curl -s 'https://tlcmap.org/layers/2749/json?metadata'`, and so is the whole `metadata` object,
key order included. The date range is computed from the records' `udatestart`/`udateend` as
TLCMap returned them; `as_written` carries the original `datestart`/`dateend` text.

### 4. The resource URI yields the feed, with a matching `sha256` — PASS

`resources/read` on `tlcmap://layer/206/features` returned `application/json` with 52 features.
Its SHA-256 is `34aa22de…7cb8`, equal to the tool's `provenance.sha256`.

### 5. Invalid input and a missing layer — PASS

`layer_id: "abc"`:

```text
isError: true
Input validation error: Invalid arguments for tool tlcmap_get_layer: layer_id: Invalid input: expected number, received string
```

`layer_id: 99999999`:

```json
{
  "isError": true,
  "error": {
    "code": "UPSTREAM_CONTRACT_VIOLATION",
    "message": "The layer feed from TLCMap did not identify itself as layer 99999999.",
    "details": {
      "request": "GET https://tlcmap.org/layers/99999999/json",
      "status": 200,
      "expected": "metadata.layer_id to equal 99999999",
      "api_metadata": {
        "warnnig": "This map either does not exist or has been set to \"private\" and therefore cannot be displayed."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. `/healthz` is 200; the journal shows `tool` and `upstream` lines — PASS

`curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://test-mcp.tlcmap.org/healthz` gives `200`.
`journalctl -u tlcmap-mcp` for the check 3 and 5 calls:

```text
{"event":"upstream","url":"https://tlcmap.org/layers/206/json","status":200,"bytes":109369,"queue_wait_ms":0,"duration_ms":164}
{"event":"tool","tool":"tlcmap_get_layer","arguments":{"layer_id":206},"outcome":"ok","cache":"miss","duration_ms":169}
{"event":"upstream","url":"https://tlcmap.org/layers/2749/json","status":200,"bytes":4457978,"queue_wait_ms":0,"duration_ms":651}
{"event":"tool","tool":"tlcmap_get_layer","arguments":{"layer_id":2749},"outcome":"ok","cache":"miss","duration_ms":707}
{"event":"upstream","url":"https://tlcmap.org/layers/99999999/json","status":200,"bytes":670,"queue_wait_ms":0,"duration_ms":90}
{"level":"warn","event":"tool","tool":"tlcmap_get_layer","arguments":{"layer_id":99999999},"outcome":"UPSTREAM_CONTRACT_VIOLATION","duration_ms":92}
```

Repeating the calls over the legacy protocol logged `tool` lines with `"cache":"hit"` for 206 and
2749 and no `upstream` line, since nothing was fetched. The `"abc"` call has no `tool` line, because
the SDK rejects it before the handler runs; it appears only in the `http` line.

The journal also shows the expected plain-text SDK warning at startup (`responseMode: 'json' drops
mid-call notifications…`), then the JSON `startup` line.

### 7. After a restart, the earlier resource URI returns `RESOURCE_EXPIRED` — PASS

`sudo systemctl restart tlcmap-mcp` logged a clean shutdown:

```text
{"event":"shutdown","version":"0.1.0","scopes":["read"],"signal":"SIGTERM"}
tlcmap-mcp.service: Deactivated successfully.
```

`resources/read` on `tlcmap://layer/206/features` then returned:

```json
{ "code": -32603,
  "message": "RESOURCE_EXPIRED: This resource is no longer held by the server. Call tlcmap_get_layer again to obtain a fresh handle.",
  "data": { "code": "RESOURCE_EXPIRED", "details": { "uri": "tlcmap://layer/206/features", "tool": "tlcmap_get_layer" } } }
```

### 8. A second release deploys, and a rollback restores the first — PASS

A throwaway branch off `v0.1.0` changed only the version to `0.1.1` (commit `e3620ab`).

```text
$ sudo deploy.sh a0-rollback-check
==> Switching current -> /opt/tlcmap-mcp/releases/e3620abe36ec (version 0.1.1)
==> Healthy
==> Deployed e3620abe36ec
/healthz: "version":"0.1.1"
$ sudo deploy.sh --rollback
==> Rolling back /opt/tlcmap-mcp/releases/e3620abe36ec -> /opt/tlcmap-mcp/releases/9eb16a344f2f
==> Rollback healthy
/healthz: "version":"0.1.0"
```

Afterwards the `0.1.1` release directory and the branch were deleted, so a later `--rollback` cannot
land on the throwaway build.

## Notes from the deploy

- certbot was already installed on the host as a snap, so [DEPLOY.md](https://github.com/Systemik-Solutions/tlcmap-mcp/blob/main/deploy/DEPLOY.md) step 7 now uses the existing
  certbot and runs a `--dry-run` before the real request. Step 8 now deploys a release tag rather
  than `main`.
- The repository's default branch does not yet contain the server, so the host's checkout at
  `/root/tlcmap-mcp-deploy` is on the `v0.1.0` tag (detached). Once the branch is merged, switch it
  with `sudo git -C /root/tlcmap-mcp-deploy checkout main`, so the runbook's `git pull` works.
- `npm ci` warns that `esbuild`'s install script is not covered by npm's `allowScripts`. esbuild is a
  development dependency (via `tsx` and Vitest) and the build uses `tsc`, so the release is
  unaffected.
- Apache logs `AH00558` (no global `ServerName`) on every `apachectl` run. It predates this work.
